# Food Allergen Guard
 DEEP LEARNING AND OCR BASED FOOD ALLERGEN DETECTION.
It's my 3rd year mini-project. I did this project along with my members ARDRA SR , ANAKHA PRASAD, SRUTHI S . The project is based on food allergen detection using deep learning. It helps common people with food allergies to scan or upload the ingredient label of packaged food , and provide the names of food items they are allergic with. It also provide the symptoms along with allergies detection.
